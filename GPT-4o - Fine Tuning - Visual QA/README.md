# GPT-4o-Fine-Tuning-with-Images-on-Azure-OpenAI-Service-for-Visual-Question-Answering

This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement Visual Fine Tuning of Azure OpenAI GPT-4o model for Visual Question Answer. The repository is meant to be educational rather than a production ready implementation.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to fine-tune GPT-4o with multimodal inputs. Specifically, we’ll demonstrate how to train a model for answering questions related to images of Charts, but the potential applications span countless domains.

Whether you're looking to build smarter defect detection models for manufacturing, enhance complex document processing and diagram understanding, or develop applications with better visual comprehension for a variety of other use cases, this guide will show you just how fast and easy it is to get started.
